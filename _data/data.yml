          At CarSys, I am working on the development of a Garage Management System that enables garages to easily manage everything from appointment management 
          and planning to ordering parts and invoicing via one online tool. The first big project I was asked to do here together with two other developers was 
          the development of a time registration tool, where employees can book their hours and you have a clear overview of who is doing what. The second project 
          I am currently working on together with a backend developer is an integration with ROB, where work cards can be sent directly to the leasing company 
          and can also be processed in sync.
