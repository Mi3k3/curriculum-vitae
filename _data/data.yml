    info:
      - role: Software developer
        time: 11/2020 - Present
        company: Car-Systems B.V. / LKQ
        details: |
          Car-Systems has more than 20 years of experience in automating garage businesses. 
          Car-Systems was created in the owner's workshop, literally on the shop floor. 
          This means that the software fits the daily routine of the workshop.
          
          At CarSys, I am working on the development of a Garage Management System that enables garages to easily manage everything from appointment management and planning 
          to ordering parts and invoicing via one online tool. The first big project I was asked to do here together with two other developers was the development of a time 
          registration tool, where employees can book their hours and you have a clear overview of who is doing what. 
          The second project I am currently working on together with a backend developer is an integration with ROB, where work cards can be sent directly to the leasing company and 
          can also be processed in sync.
        tasks: |
          Time recording module:
            - UI/UX
            - Setting up a new frontend application in react
            - Fetching via React Query
            - Frontend development   

          ROB:
            - UI/UX
            - Main focus is frontend and a few backend additions.
            - Integration of ROB within the current GMS (FE)
            - Work order
            - Tyre change
            - Courtesy vehicles
            - Service (via TecRMI)
            - Repair time (via TecRMI)
            - Set up React modules as generically as possible because in addition to ROB, other leasing companies will also be integrated
          
          GMS:
            - Convert Navigation to Material UI v5
            - Make additional purchases possible for different vehicles at once

        company: Fairplay Casino’s
        details: |
          Fair Play casinos are entertainment centres with a wide variety of games of chance, where anyone of legal age can play. 
          Fair Play has several casinos in Europe and also online. 
          
          Online casino platform offering slot games, table games and live casino games. 
          Both platforms had to be converted according to the new house style and had to comply with the legislation of the relevant country. 
          In addition, security and authentication played an important role for these platforms.
          The biggest adaptation for the Spanish casino, besides language and design, was a slot module which enables a player to determine in advance 
          how long he wants to play, how much money he wants to spend, how often he is reminded of his current balance and how long he does not want 
          to play again after the session has ended. As the Spanish platform was an extension of the current platform, the Dutch platform is a completely 
          new platform. It will contain the same functionalities, but the structure and programming language are different.
        tasks: |
          For the Spanish platform, I adapted the current platform according to the Spanish legislation. Both backend and frontend.
