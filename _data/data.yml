        company: Vlaamse overheid  - consultant for Merapar
        details: |
          For the Flemish government, I played a key role in developing an e-portal tailored for individuals under electronic monitoring. This user-friendly platform 
          serves as a self-service hub, enabling users to check their file status, access information about electronic monitoring, and handle administrative tasks 
          independently—such as managing work schedules and personal information. This not only empowers users but also eases the workload for VCET staff, allowing them 
          to focus on more impactful interactions. My primary responsibility involves creating the frontend for this e-portal.  
          At the same time, I led and was owner of a project where we styled Primeng components to align with the VO web components in Vue. 
          This project involved making the library accessible through an npm registry, ensuring a seamless integration of styled components.

        details: |
          At LKQ - Car-Systems B.V., I played a key role in developing a comprehensive Garage Management System. This all-in-one solution 
          simplifies garage operations, handling everything from appointment scheduling to parts ordering and invoicing within a unified online platform.  
          In collaboration with a skilled team, we created a time registration tool, providing employees with a clear overview of tasks and schedules. 
          Additionally, I worked on integrating our system with ROB, streamlining the direct dispatch of work orders to leasing companies.  
          Simultaneously, I contributed to enhancing the existing GMS platform by upgrading it to MUI5 and implementing new features. 
          This multifaceted experience demonstrates my commitment to innovation and optimization in software development.

        company: Fairplay Casino’s  - consultant for Assign
        details: |
          Fair Play casinos are versatile entertainment hubs offering a diverse range of games accessible to legal-age players through both physical locations 
          and online platforms. The online casino section features slots, table games, and live casino games. A key focus was the adaptation of the online platform 
          to new style guides and compliance with relevant country legislation, prioritizing security and authentication.  For the Spanish casino, significant 
          modifications included language and design updates, with a notable addition being a customizable slot module. This feature allows players to pre-determine 
          play duration, spending limits, balance reminders, and post-session downtime preferences. The Spanish platform served as an extension to the existing one.  
          In contrast, the Dutch platform is an entirely new creation, maintaining similar functionalities but employing a distinct structure and programming language. 
          This dual approach reflects the adaptability and innovation necessary in meeting diverse market requirements.
