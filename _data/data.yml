      - role: Software developer
        time: 11/2020 - Present
        company: Car-Systems B.V. / LKQ
        details: |
          Car-Systems B.V. is a software development company that provides a "one stop" solution for garages. 
          
          At CarSys, I am working on the development of a Garage Management System that enables garages to easily manage everything from appointment and planning 
          to ordering parts and invoicing via one online tool. The first big project I was asked to do here together with two other developers was the development of a time 
          registration tool, where employees can book their hours and you have a clear overview of who is doing what. 
          The second project I was working on together with a backend developer is an integration with ROB, where work orders can be sent directly to a leasing company and 
          can also be processed in sync. At the moment we're upgrading the frontend tool to mui5 and implementing new features.
        tasks: |
          Time registration module:
            - UI/UX
            - Setting up a new frontend application in react
            - Fetching via React Query
            - Frontend development   

          ROB:
            - UI/UX
            - Main focus is frontend and a few backend additions
            - Integration of ROB within the current GMS (FE)
            - Work order
            - Tyre change
            - Courtesy vehicles
            - Service (via TecRMI)
            - Repair time (via TecRMI)
            - Set up React modules as generically as possible because in addition to ROB, other leasing companies will be integrated
          
          GMS:
            - Convert Navigation to Material UI
            - Make additional purchases possible for different vehicles at once
            - Add Storybook
            - Create new components and functionalities

      - role: Lead front-end/ full-stack developer
        time: 07/2019 – 11/2020
        company: Fairplay Casino’s
        details: |
          Fair Play casinos are entertainment centres with a wide variety of games, where anyone of legal age can play. 
          They both have physical locations and online platforms.
          The Online casino platform offers slot games, table games and live casino games. 
          The platform had to be converted according to the new style guides and had to comply with the legislation of the relevant country. 
          In addition, security and authentication played an important role for these platforms.
          For the Spanish casino, the biggest adaptation, besides language and design, was a slot module which enables a player to determine in advance 
          how long he wants to play, how much money he wants to spend, how often he is reminded of his current balance and how long he does not want 
          to play again after the session has ended. As the Spanish platform was an extension of the current platform, the Dutch platform is a completely 
          new platform. It will contain the same functionalities, but the structure and programming language are different.
        tasks: |
          For the Spanish platform, I adapted the current platform according to the Spanish legislation. Both backend and frontend.
